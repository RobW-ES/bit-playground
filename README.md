# An Example Bit Powered Project

[Bit](https://bit.dev) is a tool for sharing code components across teams and projects.

It runs within an existing projects, so instead of sharing your hole project as you do with git you can just share useful aspects of it.

You can track changes to, tag and import components via NPM into other projects. Please read the [Quick Start guide](https://docs.bit.dev/docs/quick-start) for further information.  

## Details

This project provides an example of how a Bit powered project works. Components are tracked via the `.bitmap` file. 

There are two tracked Typescript components: 

- [Appender](https://bit.dev/robw-es/test-one/appender)
- [Counter](https://bit.dev/robw-es/test-one/counter)

There are stored locally in the `src/components` [directory](https://github.com/RobW-ES/bit-playground/tree/master/src/components).
